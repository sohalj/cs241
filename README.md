prog1: This is a language learner program. It parses a txt file and determines the number of times     one word follows the other. Then based of those statistics it generates random sentences. The LanguageLearner.java file is what me and my partner implemented and Program1 is the driver for it. 

TO RUN: run using Program1 as driver instructions, for arguments to run it are in the file.

prog2: Is a voice recognition program that uses lattices to determine what was said. Lattices are weighted and paths are generated to come up with the best hypothesis of what was said. Me and my partner worked on the Lattice, Edge and Hypothesis files.Program2 file is the driver and was give to us.
