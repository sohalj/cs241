<s> what for most of three quarters was an afternoon of slumber for the seattle seahawks ultimately turned into a day of history </s>
<s> seattle pulled off a shocking rally to beat the houston texans 23-20 in overtime and improve to 4-0 for the first time since the seahawks entered the league in 1976 </s>
<s> steven hauschka won the game for seattle with a 45-yard field goal with 319 left in the overtime as the seahawks came back from a 20-3 halftime deficit </s>
<s> seattle got into field goal range after a third-down pass to doug baldwin coupled with a 15-yard personal foul on houston’s kareem jackson </s>
<s> that moved the ball to the houston 36 and after three more plays hauschka made the kick </s>
<s> seattle was dominated for most of the first three quarters but used three houston turnovers to score 13 points including a game-tying 58-yard interception return by richard sherman </s>
<s> houston had a 443-226 edge in yards at the end of regulation indicative of how the texans controlled the action for most of the game </s>
<s> houston was attempting to get a first down that might have sewed up the game as it faced a third-and-four with 251 left but then houston quarterback schaub who has become known for throwing killer interceptions rolled left and then threw back across the field under pressure to tight end owen daniels </s>
<s> but sherman stepped in front of the pass at the 42 and then raced to the end zone for to tie the score </s>
<s> seattle appeared lifeless through most of the first three quarters its remade offensive line dominated and its defense surprisingly vulnerable </s>
<s> seattle’s comeback started in earnest when it drove 98 yards in 14 plays on a drive that began late in the third quarter and ended with a 3-yard marshawn lynch run with 728 left in the game that cut the texans’ lead to 20-13 </s>
<s> the drive was jumpstarted when russell wilson hit baldwin for a 24-yard gain on a third down play the pass was initially ruled incomplete before coach pete carroll threw the challenge flag and the call was overturned on review </s>
<s> later in the drive a penalty and a sack forced a second-and-24 situation that appeared likely to doom seattle’s hopes but seattle picked it up converting on fourth-and-three when wilson — who decided to start running more in the second half and finished with 77 yards — scrambled for four yards to the houston 3-yard-line lynch scored on the next play </s>
<s> seattle then forced a three-and-out and after a golden tate punt return of 16 yards took over at the houston 47 with 605 left </s>
<s> that drive ended quickly as on third-and-nine wilson was forced out of the pocket and threw a desperation pass to jermaine kearse that was picked off by johnathan joseph at the 43 with 513 left </s>
<s> houston got one first down and appeared ready to put the game away before the sherman interception </s>
<s> schaub who heard plenty of boos as he came back on the field rallied quickly to lead the texans into seattle territory </s>
<s> a 16-yard pass to deandre hopkins allowed houston to move the ball to the 44 with 34 seconds left </s>
<s> but a third-and-five pass was incomplete under heavy pressure and the texans then punted sending the game to overtime </s>
<s> houston piled up 324 yards in the first half in taking a 20-3 halftime lead </s>
<s> houston was forced to punt on its first drive of the game but otherwise had their way with a seattle defense that came in allowing just 2417 yards per game the seahawks no 1 defense had allowed just one touchdown drive of longer than two yards in its first three games </s>
<s> seattle scored first using a 33-yard pass interference penalty to set up a 42-yard hauschka field goal </s>
<s> otherwise a seattle offense playing without starting center max unger and right tackle breno giacomini — and already without starting left tackle russell okung who will be at least another six games with a toe injury — was ineffective throughout the first half </s>
<s> seattle managed just four first downs and 88 yards — 45 coming on one run by marshawn lynch when he broke numerous tackles — and had just 24 yards passing in the first half </s>
<s> schaub meanwhile was sharp throughout leading houston on consecutive scoring drives of 90 and 80 yards in the second quarter to put the home team in command </s>
<s> schaub capped the first drive with a 31-yard pass to tight end garrett graham who got behind linebacker mike morgan who was in the game for a temporarily injured kj wright </s>
<s> the second touchdown came on a 5-yard pass to running back arian foster </s>
<s> the texans added two randy bullock field goals in the final 351 of the half to take a 20-3 lead at halftime </s>
<s> seattle began to get back into it when malcolm smith forced a fumble by ben tate that bobby wagner recovered at the houston 21 </s>
<s> but three seattle plays resulted in three incomplete passes the final attempt indicative of the day as wilson was forced at the snap to scramble away from heavy pressure and unable to connect </s>
<s> hauschka kicked a 39-yard field goal to make it 20-6 </s>
<s> the game was delayed roughly 10 minutes with 25 seconds left in the first half following an injury to seattle defensive end michael bennett who was hurt while attempting to sack schaub bennett appeared to get pushed head first into schaub and his helmet flew off and he then landed hard face down on the turf </s>
<s> bennett was taken to a local hospital where he was reported to have movement in all of his extremities he was being treated for a lower back injury it was later reported that ct scans were negative and bennett returned to stadium </s>
<s> seattle will go on the road again next week when it plays at indianapolis </s>
<s> amid the record-setting roar from the crowd and the delay-inducing lightning and thunder sunday night cliff avril finally made a little noise of his own </s>
<s> avril was one of two prize free agents signed by the seahawks in the offseason with michael bennett the other each was brought in to help a pass rush that proved problematic down the stretch of the 2012 season </s>
<s> sunday during the 29-3 rout of san francisco the seahawks were able to see for the first time what their investment of $18 million looks like on the field ( avril signed a two-year deal worth $13 million bennett signed for one year and $5 million ) </s>
<s> and monday coach pete carroll needed just one word to describe how it made him feel thrilled </s>
<s> avril and bennett sparked a defensive front that harassed san francisco quarterback colin kaepernick all night sacking him three times and also put a harness on the 49ers’ running game san francisco rushed for 100 yards but 87 came on scrambles by kaepernick san francisco’s running backs managed just 13 yards on 11 carries including only 16 on nine from frank gore </s>
<s> we were physically up for the challenge carroll said i think we played the line of scrimmage great the defense was on it </s>
<s> avril who missed the opener against carolina with a hamstring injury and bennett each had sacks avril’s sack forced a fumble late in the second quarter to set up a seattle field goal </s>
<s> michael bennett has done a nice job been such a factor said carroll it’s great that cliff finally gets a chance to play and he was really a factor early and really had a chance to get three sacks in the game cool to see that happen right off the bat </s>
<s> in fact it was missed sacks that seemed foremost on bennett’s mind after the game </s>
<s> i missed two by myself cliff missed one ( defensive end ) red ( bryant ) missed two he said we should’ve had a nine-sack night but those things happen and you know we’ve got to get better at that but we pushed good tonight” </s>
<s> that was the plan when seattle signed bennett and avril bennett began his career with seattle as an undrafted free agent in 2009 before being released and becoming a starter with tampa bay where he spent the past four seasons avril became known as one of the best pass rushers in the league the past five years in detroit with 395 sacks </s>
<s> avril gave most of the credit sunday to the secondary saying they allowed us to rush made him ( kaepernick ) hold the ball a little longer than usual and we got after him a little bit </s>
<s> still the performance of the line was hard to ignore serving as yet another reason for optimism in a season dripping with it </s>
<s> seattle is still without end chris clemons who led the team in sacks last year with 115 and bruce irvin who had eight </s>
<s> clemons is recovering from a knee injury and could return this week against jacksonville carroll said monday if not clemons will almost certainly play the following week at houston </s>
<s> irvin is sitting out the first four games while suspended for violating the league’s policy on performance-enhancing drugs </s>
<s> carroll said left tackle russell okung is almost certainly out for the game sunday against jacksonville after injuring his toe against the 49ers otherwise though carroll offered few specifics about an injury that could be critical if it proves to be long-term </s>
<s> carroll said of okung’s injury there’s a little bit of a spectrum of how serious it could be and how long he could be out espn reported that okung had a torn ligament but carroll did not confirm that saying we are still digging for information … i know there’s some stuff that happened there and we are waiting to figure it out if i told you something i’d be making it up </s>
<s> carroll also was vague on whether the plan would be to again go with paul mcquistan at left tackle as was the case sunday when okung went down another possibility could be rookie alvin bailey who is listed as okung’s backup though he has yet to play </s>
<s> the only other injury of note sunday was suffered by fullback spencer ware who suffered a significant ankle sprain on the final offensive play of the game carroll said it’s unclear how long he might be out </s>
<s> carroll also said cornerback brandon browner is expected to return to practice wednesday with the intent to play against the jaguars browner has missed the first two games with a hamstring injury </s>
<s> indianapolis’ trade with cleveland for running back trent richardson this week wasn’t a holy cow moment solely for what happened but also that it happened at all </s>
<s> what happened to review is that the browns threw up the white flag on the season two games in dealing a player thought to be a centerpiece of their future for a 2014 no 1 pick while making a concession they are again starting over </s>
<s> the colts meanwhile now have the no 1 ( quarterback andrew luck ) and no 3 ( richardson ) overall picks from the 2012 draft they’re also delivering a statement they are serious about making a run at the super bowl this season in a jumbled afc the broncos can’t seem to keep any offensive linemen healthy and traditional powers like the patriots ravens and steelers appear vulnerable </s>
<s> that it happened at all however was just about as eyebrow raising </s>
<s> such in-season trades just don’t occur often in the nfl nothing at all like in baseball or the nba where in-season player swapping is simply part of the deal </s>
<s> a few of the generally accepted reasons for the lack of in-season nfl trades are 1 that it’s harder than in baseball or the nba for a new player to get fully acclimated into an nfl system to make it worthwhile to make a trade during the season 2 the salary cap and its assorted complications and 3 the value of future draft picks versus the production of a veteran a recent study by footballperspectivecom for instance detailed that 46 percent of a team’s production comes from players in the first four years of their careers </s>
<s> how rare are in-season trades the seahawks have made just 16 such deals since beginning play in 1976 </s>
<s> most weren’t earth-shattering and often involved low-round picks for a veteran who could fill an immediate need </s>
<s> four russell wilson touchdown passes rare a thought about each </s>
<s> 1 corner route to zach miller when tight end luke willson went in motion and safety josh evans followed it was confirmed to wilson that jacksonville was in man-to-man coverage </s>
<s> the quarterback’s job then was to sell the run fake to marshawn lynch wilson did so by projecting casual body language — including momentarily keeping his back entirely to the defense — suggesting he had in fact given the ball to lynch </s>
<s> linebacker geno hayes who had miller in coverage bought all of it and miller who had executed a diving fake cut-block rose and found himself all alone </s>
<s> 2 flat route to miller the motioning of doug baldwin to fake a slot reverse caused the jaguars to fail in communication between the linebacker paul posluszny and safety johnathan cyprien to augment the backfield fake the offensive line stepped in unison to the left though wilson was to roll right thus cornerback mike harris who had aligned much like a 3-4 rush linebacker was unblocked </s>
<s> wilson’s pump-fake/pirouette will leave harris shamed in film study and jaguars coach gus bradley wondering how a cornerback could look so clunky </s>
<s> 3 seam-read post to sidney rice with jacksonville in a 5-under 2-deep zone and seattle in an empty backfield with three receivers to wilson’s right and two to his left posluszny had to favor the three-receiver side critical errors were made in coverage by jaguar safeties — who each were aligned too wide allowing rice easy access to the middle of the field — and by geno hayes — who inexplicably stood flat-footed while rice sauntered to the post </s>
<s> seattle offered no fake or misdirection on the play so hayes should have known to run with rice </s>
<s> when the hawks fake the wide zone as opposed to the inside zone the offensive linemen tend to stand straighter as they are attempting to block their defensive counterparts this seems to add an additional level of deception as defenders are momentarily convinced that the ball is with the halfback </s>
<s> on this play wilson had time to go to his fourth option rice and float a 50/50” ball to the end zone — just in front of where i happened to have been standing with the ball in the air i thought wilson made a poor decision but evans’ poor ball skills on the play was no match for rice a one-time mr basketball” in the state of south carolina </s>
